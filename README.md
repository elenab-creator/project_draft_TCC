# MY FINAL PROJECT
A one or two sentence description of your project here.

- What does it do?  
  

- What is the "new feature" which you have added that we haven't seen before?  
  

## Prerequisites
Did you add any additional modules that someone needs to install (for instance anything in Python that you `pip install-ed`)? 
List those here (if any).

## Code development
As I started working on the project in a "draft" directory, you can see all the progress of the development of my project in this repository: https://github.com/elenab-creator/project_draft_TCC

## Project Checklist
- [x] It is available on GitHub.
